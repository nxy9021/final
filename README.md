## Story
You are a teacher.

During COVID time, all classes have gone remote.
Remote classes are hard! But you have a secret power:
you can “see” the student’s focus level through their
zoom backgrounds!
If you don’t keep the students engaged, they will be
constantly zoning out. Catch the students who are
distracted and get their attention back by asking them
the right type of questions!
